📱 ConnectCard – Mobile-First Design Description
1. Overall Layout
Single-page, vertically stacked layout

Full-screen height (100vh) with soft padding (16–24px)

Content is centered horizontally with a max width for readability (~375–425px)

All sections flow in a single column, with generous spacing between them

Optimized for touch interactions and fast loading on mobile networks

2. Header Section
Profile Image:

Circular, centered, 96px–120px size

Shadow or subtle border for depth

Name (Brand):

Bold text, large font (20–24px)

Center-aligned, sits directly under the image

Tagline:

Small, gray-toned font (14–16px)

Centered and spaced just below the name

Mobile Behavior:

No side margins or float—everything centered

Profile area appears at the very top, with soft breathing space above and below

3. Featured Callout Block
Positioned directly under the header

Styled as a card or banner to stand out from other links

Includes:

One short line of text, like “🚀 Be the first to try our hiring fit tool!”

A full-width button beneath it with standout background color (#FFB130)

Rounded corners, light shadow, and padding inside the box

Mobile Behavior:

Full-width button is easily tappable with one thumb

Box has generous margin to separate it from other sections

4. Main Link Stack
A list of stacked buttons, vertically aligned with equal spacing (12–16px between)

Each button includes:

Clear label (e.g., “Visit Blog”, “Connect on LinkedIn”)

Optional emoji or icon prefix

Consistent size: full-width, tall enough for comfortable taps (~48px min height)

Buttons are rounded, with hover/tap effects like subtle darkening or scale

Mobile Behavior:

Responsive to taps with instant feedback

Scrollable if content exceeds screen height

All buttons stay centered and aligned even on small devices

5. Social Media Icons
Row of small social icons (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub) at the bottom

Icons are evenly spaced (e.g., 12–20px apart)

Each icon is a touch-friendly square or circle (~24–32px) with a subtle hover effect

Clicking an icon opens the social profile in a new tab

Mobile Behavior:

Icons don’t stack—always inline, centered

Adequate space around each for fat-finger usability

6. Footer (Optional)
Tiny centered line of text like: “Built with ❤️ by SkillConnect”

Font is very small and gray—meant to be subtle

Optionally, a QR code or mini badge (can be shown only on larger screens)

7. Branding & Visual Design
Primary Brand Color: #FFB130 (for highlight actions like CTA buttons)

Font Style: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Helvetica, or system default)

Color Palette:

Background: white or light gray

Text: black or very dark gray

Accent: gold highlight

Spacing: Generous vertical spacing between each section to reduce crowding

8. Responsive Behavior for Desktop
The design remains centered with a max-width constraint (~425px), even on wider screens

Minor enhancements:

Hover transitions for buttons and icons

Slight enlargement of font and image for better visibility

Use quality emoji, to convey trust and boost interest

No sidebar, no multi-column layout—this remains a single-column vertical stack, even on desktop
